/**
 * DraftAssetSwapFlow sets up the initial swap agreement and stores the draft transaction for later access.

 * @param recipient the new owner for the generic asset once this transaction is successfully unlocked
 * @param notary the trusted notary for this transaction

 * @param unlockEvent the event encoder that generates the revert and unlock events that once received and proved, allow
